# Hospital Scheduling Management System

This is a full-stack web application designed to manage appointments, doctor-patient scheduling, and system monitoring workflows in a hospital or clinic. It provides interfaces for staff to manage appointments, assign doctors, and monitor activities through an admin dashboard.


## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React (TypeScript), Vite, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM
- **Security:** JWT, Bcrypt (password hashing), Speakeasy (2FA), Zod (validation), CORS
- **DevOps:** Docker, Docker Compose, Railway (PaaS)
- **Tooling:** ESLint, Prettier, Morgan (logging)

## Live Demo

The application is deployed on **Railway**:

ðŸ”— **Frontend:** [https://frontend-production-5fd8.up.railway.app](https://frontend-production-5fd8.up.railway.app)


## Project Setup Instructions

### Setting Up the Backend
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your PostgreSQL database:
   - Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and running
   - Create a database named `hospital_schedule`
   - Update the `.env` file with your database credentials if needed

4. Seed the database with initial data:
   ```
   npm run seed
   ```
   This will create:
   - Admin user: admin@example.com / password
   - Regular user: user@example.com / password
   - 100,000+ sample schedule records

5. Start the backend server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   The backend server will run on http://localhost:5000

### Setting Up the Frontend
1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the project root directory

2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.npmrc` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```
   legacy-peer-deps=true
   ```

4. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend application will be available at http://localhost:8080

## Using the Application

### Login Credentials
- **Admin User**: 
  - Email: admin@example.com
  - Password: password

- **Regular User**: 
  - Email: user@example.com
  - Password: password

### Main Features

1. **Appointment Scheduling:** Add, view, update, and delete hospital appointment records with assigned doctors, departments, and timestamps.
2. **User Authentication & Roles:** JWT-based login system supporting both Admin and Regular User roles.(Register new users or login with existing accounts)
3. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Optional 2FA via time-based OTP (TOTP) for secure logins.
4. **Search & Filters:** Intuitive schedule filtering and sorting by date, doctor, department, etc.
5. **Admin Dashboard:** Monitor system activity and suspicious users (admin only)
6. **Audit Logging:** All schedule modifications (create, update, delete) are stored securely.
7. **Scalability:** Seeded with over 100,000 schedule entries to test large-scale performance.
8. **Health Monitoring:** `/health` endpoint and real-time socket events (connect/disconnect detection) for operational visibility.


## Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible
- Check that the database credentials in the `.env` file are correct
- Verify that port 5000 is not in use by another application

### Frontend Issues
- If you encounter dependency conflicts, ensure the `.npmrc` file contains `legacy-peer-deps=true`
- Clear browser cache if you experience unexpected behaviors
- Check the browser console for any error messages

## Performance Monitoring

For Silver tier performance testing, JMeter or similar tools can be used to test the API endpoints under load.

## Security Features

The system includes a monitoring thread that detects suspicious activity:
- Tracks users with high activity rates
- Identifies potential attack patterns
- Alerts admins via the dashboard
